# How to Set Up OpenSearch Cluster Monitoring Alerts

Validated on 17 Jun 2024 • Last edited on 23 Jan 2025

OpenSearch is an open-source search and analytics suite which serves as a centralized location to manage logs forwarded from other resources, such as databases and Droplets.

You can set alert policies based on your [cluster performance metrics](/products/databases/opensearch/how-to/monitor-clusters/). Alert policies notify you when a performance metric rises above or falls below a threshold you set, and again when a metric returns to within the threshold. You can receive notifications via email or Slack.

## Create an Alert Policy[](#create-an-alert-policy)

To create an alert policy, click the name of your database cluster to go its **Overview** page, then click the **Insights** tab.

![The Insights tab of a database cluster](https://docs.digitalocean.com/screenshots/databases/opensearch-insights-tab.b8f561bfecd762fcc82877acc1164a33d28c77e7d91040b931c025db0fb292e4.png)

Click the **Manage alert policies** button to open the **Manage alert policies** window.

![Creating an alert policy](https://docs.digitalocean.com/screenshots/databases/alert-policy.f042f2c5c616a26c0c17e825cde1dcadde0421f2d7ce6b4f84c1dcb30aa8f619.png)

Enter the following information in the **Create alert policy** tab to set up an alert:

*   **Specify metric & set threshold**: Specify the following settings:
    
    *   The performance metric that you want to create an alert for, like CPU usage or disk usage.
        
    *   The numerical threshold above or below which the alert condition triggers, such as above 70% usage or below 50% usage.
        
    *   The length of time a threshold must be breached before the alert notification triggers, like 5 minutes or 1 day. The performance metric you’re alerting on is averaged over this interval to determine if it violates the threshold.
        
*   **Select Clusters or tags**: Choose the clusters or tags the alert policy applies to. You can also choose **All clusters**.
    
*   **Send alerts via**: Choose at least one method of notification. You can receive notifications via email using the email on your account and the email of any [team members](/platform/teams/) or [Slack](https://slack.com/).
    
    Slack notifications require Slack authentication. Click **Connect Slack** to authenticate. Once you are authenticated to Slack, you can select any Slack team, direct message group, or individual members to which you have access.
    
*   **Name and create alert policy**: Give the alert policy a descriptive name, and then click **Create alert policy**.
    

It may take up to a few minutes for the newly-created alert policy to start evaluating data.

## Manage Alert Policies and Triggered Alerts[](#manage-alert-policies-and-triggered-alerts)

From the **Insights** tab, click the **Manage alert policies** button to open the **Manage alert policies** window. Then, click the **Existing alert policies** tab.

You can view all of your existing alert policies here. If an alert is triggered, it appears in a **Triggered Alerts** section of this tab, and untriggered alerts are under **Alert Policies**.

![Triggered alert policy](https://docs.digitalocean.com/screenshots/databases/alert-firing.ed95582bc8257e7a4d83598e5f394c347632bf2b3fd88cadb9c966b41dddaca9.png)

Click an alert policy’s **More** menu and select **Edit** to modify the alert policy. You can also delete an alert policy from the **More** menu, which permanently removes the alert policy without confirmation.
