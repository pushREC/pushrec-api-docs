# Shared Responsibility Model

Validated on 17 Jun 2024 • Last edited on 17 Jun 2025

OpenSearch is an open-source search and analytics suite which serves as a centralized location to manage logs forwarded from other resources, such as databases and Droplets.

As a managed service provider, DigitalOcean provides stability and security to your database clusters. However, some best practices for database management still fall under the user’s responsibility. For example, while DigitalOcean takes full responsibility for hosting physical infrastructure and ensuring network security, users are responsible for managing client-side encryption, the database firewall, and access to data.

To ensure the security of your database clusters, the following shared responsibility model describes exactly which operations and security measures users are responsible for and which DigitalOcean is responsible for:

User’s Responsibilities

DigitalOcean’s Responsibilities

Manage users and their permissions

Ensure physical security of servers and OS

Control network access through trusted sources

Provide backup and recovery options (PITR, restore from backup, fork databases)

Monitor database performance by creating alert policies

Monitoring via health checkups and auditing database logs

Add high availability and scalability

Provide standby and read-only nodes, automated failover

Protect cluster’s data (unauthorized access, data validation)

Encrypt data at rest (LUKS) and in transit (SSL)

Optimize databases and queries

Provide data durability and redundancy

Change variables via the DO API

Restart databases
