# How to Destroy Namespaces

Validated on 23 May 2022 • Last edited on 9 Apr 2025

Functions are blocks of code that run on demand without the need to manage any infrastructure. Develop on your local machine, test your code from the command line (using `doctl`), then deploy to a production namespace or App Platform — no servers required.

Namespaces are a level of isolation and organization for functions and their settings. All functions and projects must be created in a namespace. Destroying a namespace permanently destroys all of its projects and functions.

 Command Line

Use the `doctl serverless namespaces delete` command to destroy an existing namespace, specifying either the namespace label or ID:

    doctl serverless namespaces delete example-namespace-label
    doctl serverless namespaces delete fn-EXAMPLE-ID-7c17-4446-a1dd-5b1c4c247e08

You are prompted to confirm the deletion. Type `y` then `Enter` to confirm:

    Deleting namespace 'fn-5073b12e-7c17-4446-a1dd-5b1c4c247e08' with label 'sea-turtle-fn-namespace'.
    Warning: Are you sure you want to delete this namespace? (y/N) ? y
    Namespace successfully deleted

The namespace is destroyed, along with all of the projects and functions that were in the namespace.

 Control Panel

There are two places to destroy a namespace in the control panel. First, from the namespaces listing on the main [Functions page](https://cloud.digitalocean.com/functions) you can click the **…** “more” menu next to a namespace, then select **Destroy Namespace**:

Alternately, from inside the namespace you can click its **Settings** tab, then choose **Destroy**.

Either method presents you with a confirmation prompt. Enter the ID of the namespace then press **Destroy** to confirm.

The namespace is destroyed, along with all of the projects and functions contained within.
