](#configuration-overview)

Configuration overview

Claude Code supports flexible configuration options that allow you to combine different providers and infrastructure:

Understand the difference between:

*   **Corporate proxy**: An HTTP/HTTPS proxy for routing traffic (set via `HTTPS_PROXY` or `HTTP_PROXY`)
*   **LLM Gateway**: A service that handles authentication and provides provider-compatible endpoints (set via `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL`, `ANTHROPIC_BEDROCK_BASE_URL`, or `ANTHROPIC_VERTEX_BASE_URL`)

Both configurations can be used in tandem.

### 

[​

](#using-bedrock-with-corporate-proxy)

Using Bedrock with corporate proxy

Route Bedrock traffic through a corporate HTTP/HTTPS proxy:

Copy

Ask AI

    # Enable Bedrock
    export CLAUDE_CODE_USE_BEDROCK=1
    export AWS_REGION=us-east-1
    
    # Configure corporate proxy
    export HTTPS_PROXY='https://proxy.example.com:8080'
    

### 

[​

](#using-bedrock-with-llm-gateway)

Using Bedrock with LLM Gateway

Use a gateway service that provides Bedrock-compatible endpoints:

Copy

Ask AI

    # Enable Bedrock
    export CLAUDE_CODE_USE_BEDROCK=1
    
    # Configure LLM gateway
    export ANTHROPIC_BEDROCK_BASE_URL='https://your-llm-gateway.com/bedrock'
    export CLAUDE_CODE_SKIP_BEDROCK_AUTH=1  # If gateway handles AWS auth
    

### 

[​

](#using-foundry-with-corporate-proxy)

Using Foundry with corporate proxy

Route Azure traffic through a corporate HTTP/HTTPS proxy:

Copy

Ask AI

    # Enable Microsoft Foundry
    export CLAUDE_CODE_USE_FOUNDRY=1
    export ANTHROPIC_FOUNDRY_RESOURCE=your-resource
    export ANTHROPIC_FOUNDRY_API_KEY=your-api-key  # Or omit for Entra ID auth
    
    # Configure corporate proxy
    export HTTPS_PROXY='https://proxy.example.com:8080'
    

### 

[​

](#using-foundry-with-llm-gateway)

Using Foundry with LLM Gateway

Use a gateway service that provides Azure-compatible endpoints:

Copy

Ask AI

    # Enable Microsoft Foundry
    export CLAUDE_CODE_USE_FOUNDRY=1
    
    # Configure LLM gateway
    export ANTHROPIC_FOUNDRY_BASE_URL='https://your-llm-gateway.com'
    export CLAUDE_CODE_SKIP_FOUNDRY_AUTH=1  # If gateway handles Azure auth
    

### 

[​

](#using-vertex-ai-with-corporate-proxy)

Using Vertex AI with corporate proxy

Route Vertex AI traffic through a corporate HTTP/HTTPS proxy:

Copy

Ask AI

    # Enable Vertex
    export CLAUDE_CODE_USE_VERTEX=1
    export CLOUD_ML_REGION=us-east5
    export ANTHROPIC_VERTEX_PROJECT_ID=your-project-id
    
    # Configure corporate proxy
    export HTTPS_PROXY='https://proxy.example.com:8080'
    

### 

[​

](#using-vertex-ai-with-llm-gateway)

Using Vertex AI with LLM Gateway

Combine Google Vertex AI models with an LLM gateway for centralized management:

Copy

Ask AI

    # Enable Vertex
    export CLAUDE_CODE_USE_VERTEX=1
    
    # Configure LLM gateway
    export ANTHROPIC_VERTEX_BASE_URL='https://your-llm-gateway.com/vertex'
    export CLAUDE_CODE_SKIP_VERTEX_AUTH=1  # If gateway handles GCP auth
    

### 

[​

](#authentication-configuration)

Authentication configuration

Claude Code uses the `ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN` for the `Authorization` header when needed. The `SKIP_AUTH` flags (`CLAUDE_CODE_SKIP_BEDROCK_AUTH`, `CLAUDE_CODE_SKIP_VERTEX_AUTH`) are used in LLM gateway scenarios where the gateway handles provider authentication.

## 

[​

](#choosing-the-right-deployment-configuration)

Choosing the right deployment configuration

Consider these factors when selecting your deployment approach:

### 

[​

](#direct-provider-access)

Direct provider access

Best for organizations that:

*   Want the simplest setup
*   Have existing AWS or GCP infrastructure
*   Need provider-native monitoring and compliance

### 

[​

](#corporate-proxy)

Corporate proxy

Best for organizations that:

*   Have existing corporate proxy requirements
*   Need traffic monitoring and compliance
*   Must route all traffic through specific network paths

### 

[​

](#llm-gateway)

LLM Gateway

Best for organizations that:

*   Need usage tracking across teams
*   Want to dynamically switch between models
*   Require custom rate limiting or budgets
*   Need centralized authentication management

## 

[​

](#debugging)

Debugging

When debugging your deployment:

*   Use the `claude /status` [slash command](/docs/en/slash-commands). This command provides observability into any applied authentication, proxy, and URL settings.
*   Set environment variable `export ANTHROPIC_LOG=debug` to log requests.

##

Best practices for organizations

### 

[​

](#1-invest-in-documentation-and-memory)

1\. Invest in documentation and memory

We strongly recommend investing in documentation so that Claude Code understands your codebase. Organizations can deploy CLAUDE.md files at multiple levels:

*   **Organization-wide**: Deploy to system directories like `/Library/Application Support/ClaudeCode/CLAUDE.md` (macOS) for company-wide standards
*   **Repository-level**: Create `CLAUDE.md` files in repository roots containing project architecture, build commands, and contribution guidelines. Check these into source control so all users benefit [Learn more](/docs/en/memory).

### 

[​

](#2-simplify-deployment)

2\. Simplify deployment

If you have a custom development environment, we find that creating a “one click” way to install Claude Code is key to growing adoption across an organization.

### 

[​

](#3-start-with-guided-usage)

3\. Start with guided usage

Encourage new users to try Claude Code for codebase Q&A, or on smaller bug fixes or feature requests. Ask Claude Code to make a plan. Check Claude’s suggestions and give feedback if it’s off-track. Over time, as users understand this new paradigm better, then they’ll be more effective at letting Claude Code run more agentically.

### 

[​

](#4-configure-security-policies)

4\. Configure security policies

Security teams can configure managed permissions for what Claude Code is and is not allowed to do, which cannot be overwritten by local configuration. [Learn more](/docs/en/security).

### 

[​

](#5-leverage-mcp-for-integrations)

5\. Leverage MCP for integrations

MCP is a great way to give Claude Code more information, such as connecting to ticket management systems or error logs. We recommend that one central team configures MCP servers and checks a `.mcp.json` configuration into the codebase so that all users benefit. [Learn more](/docs/en/mcp). At Anthropic, we trust Claude Code to power development across every Anthropic codebase. We hope you enjoy using Claude Code as much as we do.
