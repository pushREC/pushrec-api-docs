# MySQL Pricing

Validated on 20 Aug 2019 • Last edited on 17 Jun 2025

MySQL is an open source, object-relational database built with speed and reliability in mind. Its large and active developer community has created many third-party applications, tools, and libraries that expand MySQL’s functionality.

There are two kinds of database cluster plans you can choose from: single node clusters and high availability clusters.

*   **Single node clusters** begin at $15.00 per month for a single node cluster with 1 GiB of RAM. Single node clusters are not highly available, but they feature automatic failover. We recommend these clusters for preliminary development and testing.
    
*   **High availability clusters** begin at $30.00 per month for a 2 GiB RAM/1 vCPU primary node with at least one $30.00 per month matching standby node for automatic failover.
    
    You can add or remove standby nodes at any time. Other features, like point-in-time recovery and read-only nodes, vary by database engine. [Learn more about feature availability](/products/databases/#feature-availability).
    
*   **Read-only nodes** begin at $15.00 per month. Read-only nodes are replicas of a cluster’s primary node located in additional geographical regions.
    

Traffic to and from [managed databases](/products/databases/) does not count against your bandwidth billing transfer allowance.

Additional storage you add to the cluster costs $0.21 per GiB per month.

## Plans for Cluster Nodes[](#plans-for-cluster-nodes)

All managed databases are deployed onto Droplets with either [shared or dedicated CPU](/products/droplets/concepts/choosing-a-plan/#shared-vs-dedicated). For a list of the Droplet plans we offer for MySQL, see the [Managed Databases pricing page](https://www.digitalocean.com/pricing/managed-databases#mysql).
