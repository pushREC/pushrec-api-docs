# MySQL Features

Validated on 20 Aug 2019 • Last edited on 17 Jun 2025

MySQL is an open source, object-relational database built with speed and reliability in mind. Its large and active developer community has created many third-party applications, tools, and libraries that expand MySQL’s functionality.

*   **Automatic updates**. You can select a weekly date and time during which the database checks and applies updates to its operating system and engine to keep the service stable and secure.
    
*   **Daily point-in-time backups**. Full cluster backups are taken daily and write-ahead-logs are maintained to allow you to restore to any point-in-time within the previous seven days.
    
*   **High availability with automated failover**. In the event of a failure, managed databases with a standby node will automatically switch data handling to the standby node to prevent unplanned downtime. [Learn more about high availability for managed databases](/products/databases/#high-availability).
    
*   **End-to-end security**. Encrypts data at rest with LUKS and in transit with SSL.
    
*   **Cluster metrics and alerting**. Cluster metrics visualizations help you monitor the performance of the nodes in a database cluster, like resource usage, to guide capacity planning and optimization. Alert policies notify you when a metric rises above or falls below a threshold you set, like high CPU or low memory.
    

### MySQL Features[](#mysql-features)

*   **Read-only nodes**. You can add read-only nodes in geographically disparate datacenters.
    
*   **Database metrics and query insights**. [MySQL-specific performance metrics](/products/databases/mysql/how-to/monitor-databases/) help you assess the health of the database, pinpoint performance bottlenecks, and identify unusual use patterns that may indicate an application bug or security breach.
    
    MySQL main server metrics include connection status, index vs. sequential reads, and operations throughput. MySQL database metrics include throughput and latency for fetches, inserts, deletes, and updates.
