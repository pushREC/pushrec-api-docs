# How to Edit a Partner Attachment's VPC Networks

Validated on 1 Apr 2025 • Last edited on 28 May 2025

A Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) is a private network interface for collections of DigitalOcean resources. VPC networks are inaccessible from the public internet and other VPC networks, and traffic on them doesn’t count against bandwidth usage. You can link VPC networks to each other using VPC peering connections.

You can add or remove VPC networks from a partner attachment on the attachment’s **Overview** page.

To add or remove VPC networks from a partner attachment, go to the [DigitalOcean Control Panel](https://cloud.digitalocean.com/), in the main menu, click **Networking**, then click the **Multi-cloud integrations** tab.

Click on the name of the partner attachment you’d like to update. This takes you to the attachment’s **Overview** page. Find the **VPC networks** card and click **Edit VPC Networks**.

![Screenshot of the partner attachment overview page showing the 'VPC Networks' card, which lists currently selected VPC networks and an 'Edit VPC Networks' button](https://docs.digitalocean.com/screenshots/vpc/partner-attachment-vpc-networks.5a9986fab42194dd5a45cbee16817414a16f25a1ac5957c415b2374bc9ceddd5.png)

A selection window pops up with a list of the region’s VPC networks.

![Screenshot of the 'Edit VPC Networks' selection window showing a search bar called 'Search for VPC networks' and a listing of VPC networks with checkboxes next to their names](https://docs.digitalocean.com/screenshots/vpc/partner-attachment-edit-vpc.b8a976f33b121398ef9949a3895d42925cd95f6821de69883ede0c8c8319d529.png)

Use the search box to filter the unselected VPC networks by name, then use the checkbox next to each network to add or remove it from the partner attachment. Selected networks always remain visible and are not filtered by the search terms.

After adding or removing the VPC networks you want linked to your partner attachment, click **Update** to save your changes. The selected VPC networks can then communicate across the partner attachment, and their routes are advertised to your remote connections through Megaport.
